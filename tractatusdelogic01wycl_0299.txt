Nothing, I sear, could be a greater mistake. Protestants as well as Roman
Catholics have their own delusions about WYCL1F; indeed Ι strongly suspect
they have some delusions in comnion; and neither side, possibly, is very
anxious to have those delusions removed. We must, therefore, look mainly to
those fearless lovers of truth who are not particularly wedded to any system
whatever, or believe firmly in their hearts that the principles which they profess
will stand the most rigid inquiry. It is to such men that the Society should
look for its principal support—to men not of any particular school of theology,
but to men of all views, whether High or Low, dissenting or rationalistic‚ who
are not afraid of the ground they stand on erumbling beneath their feet, and
are only anxious to help in the elucidation of a very interesting chapter in the
history of opinion.''-JAMEs GAlRDNER (Athenaeum), July 15, 1882.
