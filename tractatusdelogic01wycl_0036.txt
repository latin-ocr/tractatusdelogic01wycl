XXXII INTRODUCTION.

it may be made up of several partial subject8‚ copulated or disjunct‚
and some part may not be in the nominative.

Here we may stop to notice a curious conclusion to which
Wyclif's Realism leads him. He says1 that eAll twos and threes are
five' is not true, any more than that all two men and two animals
are four; because neither two nor three are five, but together they
make up five. Two men are two animals (i e. animated beings)‚
yet they do not make four, but three3 the third is the universal Animal
(or man, as I put it in the foot-note on that page) present in each,
yet really distinct from each. Further on,2 he repeats the same theory,
and devotes a chapter in De Universalibus3 to explain and defend his idea.
Each singular differs really from its universal, only by the ‘Hypo-
stasis²‚ called personality in intelligent beings. Thus, there being a
real difference, the universal and one of its singulars make two. That
the hypostasis is something real, superadded to the substance is a
well-known doctrine of the Thomists‚ opposed by Scotus3 but even
the rnost uncompromising Thomists affirm only the real difference
between one singular and another3 and asserting the real existence
of one Universal Man, conceived as really the same in all, they
denied that this concept was any more than an abstraction. Wyclif's
Realism is therefore not of the moderate type. Yet neither does it
go to the extravagant Pantheistic reveries of some Medieval philo-
sophers. The more I study it, the more Ι feel convinced that, though
at the time this work was written Wyclif had thought out the main
points of his doctrine, both theological and philosophical‚ he did not
yet see how absolutely and inexorably it bore him onwards to the
denial of annihilation‚ thence of Transubstantiation, and thence to
an insurrection against the power of Rome.

But to return to the point in discussion. If the subject is dis-
junct, i. e. divided into parts joined by the conjunction or, it may
mean the same as if it were copulated. As for copulated subjects,
we must note the sense well, to see whether they must be taken
together or no; especially as Latin adjectives are often substantives
