INTRODUCTION. V

stained with damp from f. 197 and very much stained after f. 203.
There are very few side-notes. All through there are free spaces left
for initial letters to be put in. Each page consists of one column
only. -— The first leaf after the parchment cover (marked f. 1, but
not entering into the pagination of the Wyclif MS.) has a few rules
of grammar written upon it.

I must not omit to acknowledge the cordial help which
Drs. Rudolph Beer and Herzberg-Frankel gave me when in Vienna.
Ι should undoubtedly be wanting in courtesy‚ ifI forgot Herr
Hofrath Ritter von ssirk, the head Librarian‚ who kindly allowed me
to work in the Imperial Library during the holidays. And on that
account my sincere thanks are all the more due to the causa causae
(as Schoolmen would have sai-d) of that privilege —- Sir Augustus
Β. Paget, Her Majesty's Ambassador in Vienna, whose influence
fortunately prevailed.

As regards the edition itself, as well as the work of transcribing &c.‚
Dr. Furnivall's energetic and friendly encouragements have all along
been at hand. But above all, Mr. Matthew’s suggestions and cor-
rections, modestly and diffidently set forth though they were, have
been of very great practical use to me, and Ι am very glad here to
acknowledge at least a debt of gratitude that Ι shall never be able
to repay.

Π. Anthentiozity and date of the work.

There is not a shadow of doubt that this volume, as well as
the two larges forthcoming ones, containing the third tractate of
Logicae Continuatio, and now in the publisher's hands, is the genuine
productiori of Wyclif. ln the very earliest and almost contemporary
catalogues of his writings‚ we find mention made of Logica. He
himself mentions it, notably in De Apostasia‚¹ where he alludes to
his own doctrine of the so—called ‘insolubles³, very fully set forth in
the third part of Logz'ca; and he even uses the very wordS, logica
scripture‚² which he applies to the present work.3 ssut a still better
proof is to be found in the unity of his doctrine with that of the

¹ De Apostasia‚ p. 3⁸4, l. 26 et seqq. 2 De Αροςΐακῐα, p. 84, 1. 22, 23.
Also De Benedicta lumi-natione, pp. 12, 20. ³ Logica, p. 1.
