INTRODUCTION.

Ι. The Manusoripts and. the Edition.

In the summer of 1890, [travelled to Vienna, in order to finish
the collation 'of De Blasplzemz'a, which has since been published, and
also to collate the MS. of Logica, of which Ι possessed a copy from
the unique Vienna MS. 4523, ff. 1—163 also to copy out Logicae
Continuatio, ff. 16—58, of the same MS. I had the MS. of
Prague ‘University V. E. ¹4· sent to the Imperial Library, Vienna,
and began to collate Logicae Continuatio, of which Ι knew that it
contained a part. l soon found that it must be considerably longer than
the Vienna Codex, since Wyclif's Logicae continuatio occupied from
f. 1 to f. 176 of the Prague MS. I have lettered the Vienna and
the Prague MSS„ A and B respectively in the various readings.
It will be seen that A, unique to the end of the first part of Logica
(f. 583 p. 74 of the present work) is checked and often corrected by
B as far as p. 176; and the rest of this volume is copied from A
alone. 132 pages are consequently unchecked, the MS. A being so far
unique, and unfortunately A, though perhaps in a more distinct
handwrsting, is the less correct of the two MSS. This may
account for, and perhaps to a slight extent excuse some slips and
errors of mine; while the abstruse nature of the subject may explain
certain others.

A few words may be added as to my work in the Imperial
Library of Vienna. Ι was sent to collate as many as possible of the
Wyclif MSS.; but at the discovery of the 176 closely-written solios
of Logicae Continuatio, Ι saw that it would be necessary to abandon
the idea os any other work, is l wished to copy them out. Ι was
even obliged to obtain leave to work during the six wecks' vacation,
