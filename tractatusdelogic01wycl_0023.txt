Chap. VII. Of Equipollence (p. 22, 23). It is the process of
changing the form of a proposition so as to keep the sense unchanged
This evidently depends upon the doctrine of opposition. lf esome A
is Β), then ‘not every A is not 3³. If cevery A is not Β), then ‘no
A is Β). If ‘some A is not B', then ‘not every A is B’. And so on.

Chap. VIII. (p. 24—29) may be passed over in few words,
for it deals with those modal propositions which are necessary or
impossible, and gives different significations of those two words,
which significations are repeated on p. 156 and the following ones,
with many details. What has to be said of them will be said better
at that place. The chapter ends with a remark that might seem
startling. He says1 that any attribute of God which is not essential might,
absolutely speaking, be wanting. At first sight some might think
that everything is essential in God, since He is immutable. But
Wyclif is thinking of God as V. g. Creator, Judge, Saviour, ἃς. all
of which attributes would be wanting if there had never been any
creature in existence3 and, therefore, he calls them, with doubtful
propriety, non-essential attributes. Ι say, ‘with doubtful propriety³‚
because the words tnon essencialiter inest³‚ seem to indicate that
something may exist in God after the manner of an accident that
comes and goes, thus implying change: which was certainly not
Wyclif⁷s opinion.

Chap. IX. Of flypotlzetical Propositions (p. 29—33). Two or
more propositions, united together by a particle, are called hypothe-
tical3 though more than one, their principal idea is one, and depends
on the relation between each of the propositions and the particle.
Their specific difference thus depends on the particle itself3 and as
there are seven (and, or, if, because, more than, where, when) there
are also seven sorts of hypothetical propositions: the copulative, the
disjunctive, the conditional, the causal, the comparative, the local,
and the tempor-al. But, as Wyclif himself admits (though he sustains
elsewhere2 that the number of their species is neither more nor less
