another term, 63 when independent or
otherwise resoluble, 6, 82; when ‘offi-

Terms repeated in the same proposition
must always be understood in the same
sense, 84.

Terms in the plural, 229; may be subject
or predicate, or both, ib.; the predicate
belongs to each singular that makes
up the plural subject, except in certain
stated cases, 229, 23o; v. g. when
several causes work at a given effect,
the last cause produces the effect as
some say, 230, or rather the verb in
the present is ampliated and ‘makes’
implies the whole of the making in
time, 230, 231; sophists however deny
this, ib.‚· none of these partial pro-
positions concerning a plural subject
are true distributively, 232, only col—
lecfively, 232, 233.

Thomists, the, 174.

Thought is the first principle of the
category of action, 13.

Time and place represent parts of duration
or local existence, 210.

Truth is the correspondence between any
proposition and its primary signification,
76; may be contained in false pro-
positions, 77.

Two men, with the Universal ‘Man'‚
make three, 89 and note,· but not if the
universal is left out of the account, 93.

Ubi (where) may mean anywhere in the
world, or two parts of space comprised
in a larges one, or a definite space
occupied by matter; in the last sense
two persons cannot be in the same
place, 30, 51.

Ultimate singulars are perhaps impossible
to arrive at, 101.

Unit, the, is the principle of the cate—
gory of quantity, 13.

Universal affirmative proposifions, four
ways of proving them, 853 cannot be
converted with their singulars, ib.;

butived, 86, and the subject not com-
pound, 86, 87; may be proved in-
direcssy, 87; rule for expounding them,
87; variations in the application of the
rule depend on the gender of the quan-
tifying sign, 88, or the nature of the
subject, 88, 89, if it is disjunct or co-
pulated, etc„ 89, 9ο; if composed with
an ablative absolute, 90, 91; if con-
taining a genitive case, 91; analysis of
the genitive in a subject, 923 variations
in the rule, proceeding from the verb
of the proposition, when ampliated‚ or
inchoative in meaning, 94, 95; 01 in-

difficulties with negative terms in such
cases, 95, 96; rule given when the
universal affirmative has its verb in the
past or the future, 96; sometimes the
strict observance of the rule is un-

versal affirmative into its singulars, 97,
98; variations in the exposition, pro-
ceding from the predicate, 98, 99.
Universal negative propositionS, proved
in how many ways, 1005 how its
corresponding singulars are obtained,
101; all the parts of its subject and its
predicate are distributed‚ 102; it can
be converted simply, ib.; may be proved
by showing its contradictory to be false,
104, or by proving the truth of the
converted proposition, 1o5; but it
cannot be expounded, 106.
Universals‚ 13 the word has three mean-
ings, 83 predicable universals: the
genus answers the question, what? for
specieS, 8, 9; the species answers the
question, what? for individuals, 9; the
difference answers the question, how?
ib.; the property and the accident, ib.
‘Until’‚ fallacies about, 210.

Will (to) is an act which implies a logical
difficulty3 it is possible to will and not

another, and knows he is a priest‚ he
intends to strike a priest‚ though he may
have the contrary wish‚ 189.
