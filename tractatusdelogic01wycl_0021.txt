INTRODUCTION. XVII

produce duration by their successive existence. Mathematicians
protest, but mathematicians are ruled out of court in a meta-
physical disquisition. More of this, however, is to come in its time
and place.

Chap. V. Of Propositions (p. 14—18). They are defined as
grammatical (congrua) forms of speech, that are indicative, have a
false or true signification, and can be perfectly understood. There is
the natural signification of propositions, by which any proposition
means its own existence. God exists in its natural signification
means nothing but: leis is α proposition: God exists. But in its
artificial signification, it means: lee proposition: God exzsscts, is true.

In the five-fold division of propositions into mental, vocal,
written, real, and true, the real proposition alone calls for comment.
Any individual being forms, according to Wychf, if Ι mistake not,
a proposition of a peculias sort. The person (or concrete being) is
the subject3¹ his essence is the copula or affirmation32 so that in
the place of subject, verb, and predicate, we have respectively the
person of this or that individual man, his individual essence or entity,
and his universal (?) human nature. I do not see any other explanation
of the text, though the distinction between essencia istius hominis
and sua natura is not clear. It has been suggested by Mr. Matthew
that Wyclif considers the wordS, iste homo, iste lapis (l. 12) as
equivalent to propositions, though they only name singular objects,
because their universal is understood.3 The explanation did not
seem to me to account sufficiently for the expressions employed;
but Ι wish the students of Wyclif not to lose the benefit of
Mr. Matthew’s suggestion.

The division of propositions continues, Some are hypothetical,
some categorica13 the latter class has one subject, one predicate,
and one principal copula (for a proposition may be categorical that
has more than one copula, if one of the two depends on the other).
Categorical propositions differ in quality, being either affirmative or nega-
