INTRODUCTION. XXV

particular consequence is good and each consequent really the ante-
cedent of the next argument, the consequence of the whole is
good. (6.) From a universal proposition to its subalternam, (7.) from
a particular to its corresponding indefinite, and (8.) from the general
to the particular, the consequence is legitimate. (9.) Τ111111 may follow
from falsehood‚ and (10.) the necessary from the contingent, but not
vice versa in either case. (11.) A universal negative implies its corre-
sponding singular proposition. (12.) A superior proposition implies
its inferi0r3 but there are different, and even opposed, sorts of
superiority and inferiority. (13.) We cannot at once conclude from
the inferior to its superior. There are five sorts of fallacies that
occur in such conclusions. (14.) A more general conclusion does not
imply a less general one, unless the sign all be prefixed3 (15.) but
then it does; also When implicitly or explicitly negative. (16.) When
an argument from an inferior supposition to its superior is good,
and the consequent universal, the antecedent is so too, (17.) To deny
the conclusion, admitting one premise of a regular syllogism, is to
deny the other premise. (18.) Of one of two contradictory terms
anything may predicated; but nothing of both together. (19.) A
proposition being true, it remains true if its verb be put in the
infinitive. (20.) From an affirmative proposition with a negative predi·
cate (A is not-B) to the same proposition vvith the negation trans-
ferred to the verb (A is not B), the consequence is good3 but only
for the present of the verb to be. (21.) Ais not B and A is A is
not-B, is a true conclusion. (22.) From an affirmative proposition
with a privative predicate (unjust‚ unwilling, &c.) 10 a negative
vvith a corresponding positive predicate, the consequence is good.
Chap. XIV. Of Exclusive propositions (p. 49—53). We may
leave aside the rules of exposition relative to them, because they
come again in Logicae Continuatio.¹ The other rules are: If only
A is B, every B is A. If only A is Β, then A is B, no not-A is Β,
and no Β is not-A. If only A is Β, both its exponents must be true;
if either of its exponents are false, the proposition is not true. From
tne truth of the exclusion itself, we cannot argue the truth of a
negative proposition7 minus the exclusive particle3 but the reverse
