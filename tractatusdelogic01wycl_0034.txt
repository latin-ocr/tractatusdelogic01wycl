XXX INTRODUCTlON.

Wyclif gives us one concerning the lncarnation‚ and another relative to
his own theory of‘indivisible degrees ofperfection³. Both are worth stating.
‘God is man.³ — Granted„ —- ‘God is immortal.³ —Granted too.—
eThis same God (Christ) is immortal and mortal: a contradiction.³ Here
a distinction is given: immortal in His Godhead, mortal in His humanity.
-— ‘The same being then is immortal and mortal.³ — The contradiction
is denied: the same being, yes3 from the same point of view, no.
‘Peter and Paul are both equally full of love to God during
one hour, when they both acquire an equal amount of that virtue3
at the end, Peter dies, and Paul is yet living.³ — Granted. — Then
the opponent says. ePeter and Paul will be equally perfect.³ lf this
be granted: it is objected that in the last instant (at which Peter is
dead and Paul living) the former does not continue to merit, while
the latter does, If it be denied, the opponent points out that the
indivisible quality acquired by Paul during one instant is infinitely
small, and adds nothing to his merits. Most people at the present day
would think so too. If there be not a gap here in the text, Wyclif
leaves the question unsettled. But in the Third Part of Logica‚ he
very distinctly decides it in the former way. The infinitely Small is,
in his opinion, not nothing3 far from it; it is only a thing so small
that nothing can be smaller. A point takes up no space, but still it
has entity — position, which no other point can occupy. A second
point, even though touching it, would not be in the same place.
Logicae Continuatio. Proemium (p. 75). This second preface is
a very brief summary of the two tractates contained in the rest of
this volume, and of the third tractate, which will fill up two more.
It has already been noticed in the General Survey of this work.¹
Chap. I. Of Trutlz (76—79). Truth is the correspondence of a
proposition to that which it signifies in the first place: i. e.‚ the
rnost general signification of the words. What they rnay signify
secondarily by stretching the sense descending from the universal
to the particular, or linking one idea to another by association‚ is,
therefore, quite foreign to truth3 for by that means any proposition,
however false, might be true, and any true one false. Again‚ the
same proposition, understood in two different ways, is neither true
