difference and totherness³, to be developed later.¹ Chap. XX deals
shortly with ‘beginning³, ‘ending³, and comparative proposition83
all this is completely developed hereafter. 2
Chap. XXI. Of ‘OfficiaP Terms. They have been already defined
as expressing an act of the mind or will on the abstract meaning
of the proposition that contains thern. There are elsewhere3 further
developments about the sense of scire, dubitare, &c.; but nothing,
as I said before, that can properly be construed as emateria de scime',
that was promised us in the Proemium. —— To expound this pro-
position: tI know that God exists', we must develop it thus: cThis
proposition, God exists, whose primary signification is the affirmation
of God's existence, is known to me.2 We must in like manner
expound similar propositions, such as: I understand . . . it is true
. it is false, ἃς. The reason of this roundabout way of deve-
loping thern is probably the requirements of argumentation. Suppose,
for instance, that in a public dispute this point had been proved:
‘All men know that God exist523 the opponent might perhaps protest,
if the defendes suddenly jumped from this conclusion to the other.
‘God exists². ssut by analysing the proposition, and pointing out
that ewhat is known is true), and that consequently God exists, one
can easily get out of this verbal difficulty. ln their public cdispu-
tationes³‚ the Scholastics used to be particularly severe about all arguments
being in strict, nay, in ultrastrict form. ‘Aliquis homo est mulier²
would have been attacked as implying sels-contradiction, aliquis
meaning only the masculine sex. 4
Chap. XXII. Of Obligation (p. 69 -75). This is a curious exer-
cise about which I have not been able to gather anything in modern
works, even of Scholastic logie, nor indeed in any that I have
read. Possibly it was a transient fashion in Oxford at that time. lt
certainly served a good deal towards sharpening the wits, and must
have been used mainly for that purpose alone3 for it is of little
