for scafaring. It is plain that there is in reality but one proposition
here3 analysis separates only the singular parts of the subject.

With this full explanation in our minds, we may now examine
the note1 with which this chapter closes. In every universal affirma-
tive, the subject has distributive supposition3 if it had not, it would
be collective3 but the predicate is not distributive, it may be inde-
finite, as in ‘Every man is (some) mortal³3 for we have by accidental
conversion, ‘Some mortalis a man³, which gives, by disjunctive
descent: The mortal A is a man, or the mortal Β is a man . .
or the mortal Z is a man Some mortal is a man3 Or confused,
as in ‘Every vessel necessary to seafaring is a craft’. Here the
proposition is merely the example given above, converted and
rendered universa13 by converting it back again, we see that it
requires the disjunct analysis. ln the universal negative, both subject
and predicate have distributive suppositionS. In the particular affir-
mative, both have indefinite suppositions. This is evident‚ notwith-
standing that the text ‘determinate' 2 contradicts it flatly. While this
part of the work was in proof, Ι did not see my way to correct
it by prefixing in to determinate; but now Ι think the expression is
merely a mistake of the copyist. -— In the case of the particular
negative, the subject has indefinite, the predicate, distributive
supposition.

Chap. XIII. Of Consequence (p. ιμ’-49). Consequence is to be
distinguished from the consequent, or conclusion of an argument3 it
may be styled ‘the power of an argument to conclude'. Wyclif’s
definition seems less clear: ‘a relation between antecedent and con-
sequent expressed by the conclusive particle (ergo)'. Though I am
doubtful whether expressed hy renders the Latin cum.

The chapter lays down 22 rules for judging whether an argu-
ment is conclusive or not. (Ι.) When the conclusion is formally
understood in the antecedent, the consequence is good. (2.) Itis
also good when, by contradicting the conclusion, we contradict the
antecedent, or (Β.) get a proposition that is incompatible with it.
(4.) The antecedent of the antecedent is the antecedent of the con-
sequent. (5.) When, in a chain of antecedents and consequents, each
