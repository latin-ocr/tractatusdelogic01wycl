INTRODUCTION. XXXVII

Chap. IX. Of Exclusive Propositions (p.128*142). In Latin, as
in English, the place of the exclusive, particle [Only A is 133 A is
only B) makes a great difference In the first case we must expound
by ‘A is B, and what is not A is not Β). There are of course
variations in the rule, according as the subject, verb, or predicate
vary3 and many fallacies are based upon these variations. Certain
sentences are meaningless or impossible, such as ‘Only every man is
an animaP. When the exclusive is negative (Only A is not B) the
minor exponent is a double negative (No not-A is not—B). Such
exclusive negatives contain within them an affirmation, and have
therefore aptly been called pregnant. But they are impossible
whenever the subject is positive and the predicate not transcendent.
<Transcendent³ means in Scholastic language, any of the six following
terms: ens, res, aliquid, unum, verum, and bonum, which may each
be predicated of evetything. Ι do not quite see that Wyclif is right
here, with the brief explanation he gives. ‘Only man does not run',
one of his instances‚ is certainly false. But ‘Only the material world
is not intelligent² may be disputed, it is true, but not at once set
aside as impossible. Yet here the predicate is not transcendent.

If the subject contains the idea of number, the proposition
ought to be expounded by more: ‘Only 4 A's are not ss's: minor
exponent: All things that are more than 4 A’s are B’s.² Other may
also be employed, or the usual exposition followed. — When οηζγ
determines the verb and predicate, it may be placed either after or
before the verb: Wyclif does not like, for a logical reason, to admit
any difference between ‘You only love man,³ and eYou love only
man3³¹ the exposition is in this case the same as before. In many
cases, such propositions are impossible. A man, as to space, is always
alone, strictly speaking, for no other body is in the same space3 but,
thus alone, his acts are multiple. We may say that he lives alone,
but not that he only lives, since he does many other thingS. No
man, according to the ancients,2 is only white3 he is more: musical,
standing, &o And so on of the infinite multitude of qualities every
concrete being must possess.3 Every exclusive may be expounded by
