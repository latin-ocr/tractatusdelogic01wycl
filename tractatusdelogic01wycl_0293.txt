ΜΑῩ, 1892.

THE WYCLIF SOCIETY was founded in 1882 to remove from
England the disgrace of having till then left buried in
manuscript the most important works of her great early
reformer, JOHN WYoLiF. This scandalous neglect extended
over nearly 500 years. Wyclif died in 1384. Not till 466
years after was his English Bible printed. Not till 485
years after did his Select Enylislz Worlss appear3 and not
till 1881 were the rest of his ENGLlsH works printed.

These publications shew us Wyclif in his purely English

growth and develdpment oi? hispmind, oi⁸7 to understand his
immense influence as the teacher of Huss and the originator
of the Reformation in Europe. “No writings so important
for the history of doctrine are still buried in manuscript,''
as Wyclif's, said. Dr. Shirley 27 years ago3 and their
interest is by no means confined to the theologian. The
relation of Wyclif's teaching to the later Lollards and to
the social fermentation of his own period, may be mentioned
as one among many matters in which the publication of *his
works would be of great service to the historian.

Till the Wyclif Society started, only one treatise of
importance, the Trialoyus, had ever been printedl out of the
great mass of the Reformer’s Latin writings. Published
abroad in 1525, and again in 1753, it was edited for the
Oxford University Press in 1869 by Dr. Lechler. A few
tracts (not 100 pages in all) are contained in Shirley's
Fasciculi ZizaMorzmm and this was all that England had

done up to 1882, to make the chief works of this great son
of hers accessible.

¹ All the works of his chief opponent, the Carmelite Tnoms ΝΕΤΤΕΒ, or

WALDms <because he was of Saffron XValden), have been printed over and
over agam.
