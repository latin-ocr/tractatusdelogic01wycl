XLII INTRODUCTION.

alarmed at the words. In the course of my collating and copying,
Ι once came across a passage in which Wyclif says that God does
not help the sinner whom he foreknows to be damned, not because
He is not willing, but because He foreknows that the sinner will not
accept the grace if given. This might be explained in some way or
other, but the language as it stands does not produce a good effect.
We may again set it down to our author’s fondness for seemingly
paradoxical ideas.

Chap. XIII. Of Knowledge, Doubt, etc. (p. 177—191). This
chapter is one of the least satisfactory in the work: we may there-
fore, review it rapidly. It contains first of all several distinctions of
the sense in which ‘Knowledge' is to be understood, actual or
lzabitual; experimental‚ intuitum, deductive, confused, or distinct.
Actual knowledge is an act of unhesitating belief in the truth. Thus
the unlettered may often know, where the philosopher, seeking to
prove all, is in doubt, even of the evidence of his senseS. These
two factors are necessary; unhesitating belief, and the truth of the
object.

After this there comes a series of fallacies, propounded and
solved, of which some are explained in soor-notes, others in side-
notes only, and others I have not been able to understand at all.
The fundamental idea in them all seems to be the well-known question:
Do you know what you do not know? -— Knowledge, doubt, igno-
rance, will, desire, are, as Wyclif says shortly afterwards,¹ terms that
admit of more fallacies than those of understanding, imagination,
apprehension and conception. And he instances another difficulty for
the will, tending to one thing conditionally, and absolutely to its
opposite.‘²

Chap. XIV. Of Reginnz'ng and Cessation (p. ιρι-203.) Begin-
ning and cessation are, and always have been, a puzzle to logicians. Is
the beginning of a line, a line or no? At the very instant of death, does
the subject exist? If so, we can affirm that lze dies; but then, how
can that be true, if he exists? There are endless subtleties on the
matter. To begin means the last now of non-being, and the first of
being; vice versa, to end is the last now of being, and the first of
