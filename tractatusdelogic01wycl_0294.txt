2 lee W'yclif society to Publz'sk all Wyelg'f's Latin Worlfs.

In Germany Dr. Lechler had printed a few short pieceS‚ ·
and two volumes of Polemieal T 7 acts edited by Dr. Rudolf
Buddensieg of Dresden, and 111 part paid for by the King of
Saxony, were adopted and issued as the Wyclif Society' s
volumes for 1882 and 1883. We cannot desire that
German scholars and princes should complete the work
which falls by right to Englishmen; and even if we had
reached that pitch of supine contentment it is unlikely that
our wishes would be fulfilled. It is time for us to wake up
from our lethargy, and set our hands manfully to the duty
before us.

The year 1884 was the 500th anniversary of WchF’s
death, and a few men then resolved that the Wyolif society
should be kept on foot until all the Reformer's genuine
xxiitings are given to the world through the Press. Half
of them, or rather more, have since been issued by the
Society. The rest are nearly all copied, and most of them
are in editors' hands, preparing for the press.

If only 400 members 0311 00 obtained at a guinea a year
for the Society‚ ten more years will probably see the whole
work done.

A full English abstract or digest of each of the Society’s
volumes is given in it, so as to make reference easy to the
stu-dent, and to enable the English reader to get a know-
ledge of the contents. The Society's volumes are in demy
8vo, the size of the works already published by the Oxford
Press and the Early English Text Society.

The Subscription to the Society is ONE GmNEA A YEAR‚
due on every lst of January. (An immediate (1892) pay-
nient of eleven guineas puts a new member in the position of
an original subscriber.) Each guinea entitles the subscriber
to the Society’s publications for the year for which it is
paid.l Members' names and subscriptions should be sent
either to the Honorary Seerez‘ary, John W. Standerwick,
General Post Office, London‚ EC„ or to Prof. Montagu
erows, 9, Norham Gardens, Oxford.

Any members who are able and willing to spare the
money, will help the Society’ s work very much by paying
five y'ears subscription in adv ance, as tieatises can then be
sent to press directly the Editor has prepared them, and the
v olumes can be issued as soon as they are finished. Donations
will be gladly accepted.
