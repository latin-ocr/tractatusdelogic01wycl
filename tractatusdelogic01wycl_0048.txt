XMV INTRODUCTION.

accidens is, not always but sometimes, opposed to per se. A musician
builds per accidens, an architect, per se.¹ Here there is opposition;
both expressions are tantamount to non reduplicative and reduplicative
propositions respectively (A, though not as A, is ss; A, as A, is E).

Chap. XVL: Of the Infinitely great and small (p. 212—217).
In the explanation of these terms, Wyclif largely draws upon his
system of the ‘indivisibles³. A is infinitely B, means, A is Β, and
nothing else is Β that A does not exceed in this respect. Wyclif
has hit upon the true definition — a negative one -— the ‘immea-
surable increase> of modern mathematicians. —— ls a line, ifinfinitely
long, infinitely great? If so, vve have something that is greater than
the Infinite3 for instance a surface bounded by the same line. If
We admit that every line consists of points, we must deny that any
line can be infinite. Every line, however long, contains a fixed
though immense number of points, so does a surface3 thus a line
may be equal to a great surface, and yet not infinite for all that.
If, on the contrary, we deny that system, We must admit that one
Infinite can be greater than another, as differing in kind.

cImmediate³, i. e. touching, infinitely near, or small as to
distance, is infinite in a certain sense, and must be expounded in
like manner, it is a passing beyond all finite degrees of propinquity
in space or time. Yet tvvo things, thus touching each other, are not
identica13 and tinfinitely near’ does not mean simply Infinite.

Chap. XVII. Of Comparative Propositions (217—229) Ι. Corn-
parisons of equality, viz., with the positive degree of comparison. 2
“A is as great as B A is great, and Β is great, and neither is
greater³. Note, by the by, that the comparative is used here, further
on the positive is used to expound the comparative. The fact is
that the idea of comparison is fundamental in all thought, and not

analyzable.3 —— A curious difficulty is propounded by Wyclif on
p. 218. —— A is an infinite line. Now there are an infinite multitude

of finite lines of all lengths, none being the longest of all. ls any
as long as A? No, for then one would be the longest. And yet in
an infinite multitude of lines of all lenglzts, some one must be
infinite. Here it is evident that the question itself is absurd. The
