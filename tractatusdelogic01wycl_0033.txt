INTRODUCTION. XXIX

with it, admitting any that its admission implied‚ and answering
irrelevant propositions according to their truth or falsehood. The
following instances‚ given by Wyclif, may suffice to prove that it
was not always easy to determine when a proposition was consequent
to or incompatible with another, or merely irrelevant.

Evffly man is in Rome is the assertion put forward. Though
false, it is possible3 therefore granted. Then: <Yon are in Rome³. —
Denied, as irrelevant and false. -— eYou are a man'. — Denied too,
as incompatible with the proposition already granted.

εΥοιι are dead’ is not absolutely self-contradictory (though in con-

tradiction with facts), so it is granted. -—- ‘You are alive’. - Denied. —
tYou deny your own act then’. —- No, for if dead Ι have no act at
alt, and am not answering you now. —— Many will doubtless think

that this custom of consistently maintaining a falsehood to its utmost
limits must have been confusing to the moral sense of truth and
untruth. I do not see that is was necessarily so; at any rate, Wyclif
cannot be blamed for teaching the rules of an exercise which he
found established.

tSome hand of yours does not exist.² —- Granted. —- ‘Some
hand of yours does exist.³ — Granted‚ as true and irrelevant. ‘Which
hand exists, the right one or the left?³ -— The right one. —- cIf so,

your right hand is every hand of yours (omnis manus tua)1; so
every hand of yours exists·‚ which contradicts the first proposition
that was granted. The answer, says Wyclif, is to teny the con-
sequence in this case3 or if some hand in this case means eveyjjf
hand, to deny that any hand exists.

‘No proposition is put to you’. -— Granted. — tSome propo-
sition is put to you.³ — Denied as contradictory. —— ‘This proposition
is put to you! -— Also denied. The opponent urges: ⁶1 put the
present proposition to you: therefore it is propounded.’ — It would
certainly follow9 is the answer; but the fact is denied.

These intellectual gyrnnastics may appear puerile7 as gymnastics
generally do; but I think that, owing to the traces throughout Logica
of the importance then given to the exercise, Ῐ could not give it
less space here. It was besides sometimes used for serious questions,
