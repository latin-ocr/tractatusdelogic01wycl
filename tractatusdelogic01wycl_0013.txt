INTRODUCTION. IX

and equally ignorant of the laws of Induction, butkone versed in
deductive Logic, and the other not: most assuredly the logician
would far surpass the other. Could we say the same in a parallel
case, supposing the only difference between· the two men were to
be the knowledge of the laws of Induction? That the old Scholastics
made little or no progress in scientific discovery proves nothing,
Aristotle, the greatest of logicians, was no less great in the sciences
of observation and experiment. They did not care for those fields of
knowledge, others, to them far more important, absorbed their
attention: that accounts for all. But the proof that this view of
Induction is the right one would be foreign to the scope of the
present Introduction. Wyclif thought as all Schoolmen thought at
that time, and there are reasons to believe that they were, and that
he was, right.

The plan of Wyclif’s Logica, however, may seem strange even
to those aquainted with the works of Scholastics. They generally
proceed from the more simple to the more complex. First of all,
terms are dealt with3 then propositions‚ which are but terms corn-
bined together by an affirmative or negative copula3 then argument,
which is made up of propositions; and lastly knowledge, or rather
science (scientia), usually the result of a series of arguments, Wyclif,
in the short abstract with which the work begins, says indeed a good
deal about terms and proposition, but dismisses argument in three
pages (p. 35—38) and says little enough about knowledge, except in
so far as propositions‚ containing the idea ol knowledge (doubt, δια),
form a separate class. He then, at p. 75, sets about the three
treatises that together form Logicae Continuam). The first (75—121)
deals with propositions that are purely categorical affirmations or
negationS‚ without any expressed idea to modil'y them. The second
(from p. 121 to the end of this volume) has to do with propositions
in which the negation or affirmation is more or less modified, though
it still remains to some degree categorical. The third deals at great
length with the seven lorms of hypothetical propositionsg it contains
an amount of matter about three times as great as this publi-
cation, and will fill two more large volumes. Setting aside then the
first 74 pages, which were no doubt written ns :1 convenient manual
sor beginners, Wyclif's Logica might be entitled: Os tlte various
