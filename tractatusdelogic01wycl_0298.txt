THE WYCLIF SOCIETY.

By JAMES GAIRDNER, Editor of tlze ‘⁵ Calendar of llze State Papers of
Henry Vlll„ etc. ”

“ THE WYCLIF SOCIETY is greatly in need of additional members, and the
existing members are urged to do all they can in the way of personal applica-
tion to their friends to induce others to join. For my part there is no cause
which I would so willingly help by such a method; but instead of writing
little notes to individual friends, I prefer, with your permission, to point out
the special claims of the Society in the columns of the Athenaeum.

“It is probably thought by many that the substance of WYCLIF'S writings
is pretty well known by this time, and that even if several remain unprinted‚
there can be no doubt about their general tendency. The truth is precisely
the reverse 3 the great bulk of WYCLIF’S writings remains in MS. to this day,
some of thern at Cambridge, some at Oxsord, and some at Dublin, but most
part as far away as Vienna. The handwritings cannot be read without special
training, and the best palaeographer of the present day could hardly follow the
argument until a whole treatise had been caresully transcribed.

‘It may be thought, how ever, that this is a matter for the learned; that
there are sure to be enough of special scholars interested in the work3 and
that it has no interest, after all, outside the region of antiquarian theology.
The truth, again, is precisely the reverse. The work is one that ought to
interest everybody3 but it is very hard, from various causes, to get even a
handful of men to subscribe their guinea apiece. For, in the first place, we
lose in relation to this particular object the co-operation of a large body of men
who in other cases are among the most ready to assist in the diffusiori of a
taste for early literature. You might just as well ask a Jew to a dinner on
pork as invite a Roman Catholic to join with you in helping to propagate
writings distinctly labelled as poisonous by the authorities of his own Church.
But then this is just one of the points that give them a peculiar interest. The
Church of Rome condemned the doctrines of WYCLIF, but then the Church of
Rome never put him on his trial sor them 3 sor however willing it, no doubt,
was to do so, as a matter of fact he never was really called on to defend them
while he lived, and he got leave to die unmolested. Moreover, although the
Church of Rome did not encourage men to read his writings, it did encourage
men to read the answers to them3 and unless we are sadsfied, as every
Romanist is bound to be, that the answers were perfectly fair and conclusive,
so that we can read VVYCLIF'S mind quite sufficiently through the statement of
his opinions by his antagonists, it is really incumbent on those who think
WYCLIF a great figure in history to inquire what it was that he actually did
say. WVYCLIF’S great opponent was THOMAS NETTER of &Valdem who wrote
thirty or forty years aster his death, and his ‘Doctrinale' has been printed over
and over again, while the works of WYCLIF have been suffered mostly to
remain in MS. Now, without in the least insinuating that THOMAS NETTER
of &Valden was an unfair controversialist‚ it is surely not unreasonable to
suspect that we cannot get the whole of WYCLIF'S mind through such a
channel as this. The object of NETTER was simply to seize upon certain
propositions, believed to be of a dangerous tendency, which were found in
VVYCLIF'S writings, and to consute them. WYCL1F‚ if he had been then alive,
might possibly, for aught we know, have explained his words otherwise, or
even have pointed to other passages in his writings diametrically opposed to
the interpretation put upon them by THOMAS of Walden. Moreover there is
no doubt that in some points the doctrines of W'YCLIF’S immediate followers
differed materially from his own, and how sar this confusion has extended is a
matter that requires investigation. It may quite possibly have coloured the
interpretation put upon VVYCLIF'S own words.

“But again it may be thought that the causes which prevent Roman
Catholics aiding in this publication must stimulate the energies of Protestants
all the more, so that religious zeal may be trusted to get the work accomplished.
