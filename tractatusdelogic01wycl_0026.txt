has no meaning nor supposition; it only has one when used, and
consequently when forming part of a proposition. It may be improper
when one term is used for another, as in figurative speech: Ι have
drunk a cup of wine. If the supposition is proper, it may be material,
when the term stands for itself: ‘Ass is 3 word of three letters³; or
formal when it stands for the meaning of the term. If formal, it
may be abstract (simplex) standing for the Universal which it re-
presents: ‘Man can be predicated of every individual of the species³;
or personal (personalis) standing for one or more of the objects that
belong to the abstract notion. If for one only in particular, it is
called singular, if for more, it is common. In the latter case, it may
stand for many together, and is called collective, or for many
separate1y3 it is then universal, and becomes — according as the
affirmation or the negation to all of those many, or to some one
or other that cannot be poined out -— either distributive or inde-
finite (confusa tantum).1 ssut the words confusa tantum may be
understood in two senses, which other Schoolrnen (l know not if
earlier or later than Wyclif) distinguished thus. ln one sense, the
term in question is affirmed only of a certain number of objects,
which are not known, but which exclude all others from the
affirmation of that term. Thus: ‘Some rnen are white³. If a certain
number only of given men are white, the rest cannot be so. This
is properly called Indefinite supposition But if we say: ‘Some craft
is necessary for seafaring,³ the term enecessary for seafaring³ is
affirmed equally well of one ship as of another. This supposition
alone receives properly the name of Confzised.

Thus there are four sorts of personal supposition: distributive,
collective, indefinite, and confused. But as the words confusa tantum
will occur very frequently throughout this work, Ι must remark that
though in the side—notes I have made them generally bear the
meaning of indefinite, they are rarely tantamount to the present
sense of Coqfused.

Corresponding to this fourfold division of persona] supposition‚
there is 3 fourfold analytical descent from a general proposition to
its singulars. Wyclif does not mention it, though, all along there are
