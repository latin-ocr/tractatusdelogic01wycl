lNTRODUCTlON. XXI

prof. Bain gives the very same process: first, what he calls obversion,
and second, simple conversion.1 Wyclif remarks very truly that there
is more difficulty about the conversion of terms that include the
past and the future. He recommends changing the verb fuit into
est vel fuit; erit into est vel erin with what success, the reader may
see in the text and foot-note. Ι think that in every case it is enough
to analyze the verb in the past or future into a present verb with
a past or future participle; and then proceed as before.

Chap. XI. Of Argument (p. 35—38). Much has already been
said in the general survey, of Wyclif's curt manner of dealing with
this part of his subject. We need not return to it, unless to point
out more fully than before, what the ‘expositoriaP syllogism is. It
is a syllogism in which the middle term, instead of being universal,
is singular, which amounts to the same, as: <This person is Victoria3
this same person is Queen of England3 therefore, Victoria is Queen
of England³. We have given an instance in the third figure, in which
it was much employed, says Wyclif.2 ssut he denies its power, when
applied to a Universal reality. eThis real thing (meaning the Uni-
versal Man) is Peter3 this same real thing is Paul Peter is Paul.

Chap. XII. Of Supposition (p. 38--43). This is a point which
is pretty nearly unknown, at least by name, to modern logicians,
and so far as I am aware, in substance also. Scholastic authors
generally deal with it immediately before Opposition, Equipollence‚
Conversion and Argument, as it helps to elucidate those processes,
giving the reason why, for instance, the universal negative can be
converted simply (see above) and not the universal affirmative. We
must explain this chapter in some detail, both because the chapter
is little known, and because it is important for the sequel3 whereas
the short notice given by Wyclif is quite inadequate, at least for us.

Supposition is here defined as the signification of one cate-
gorical extremity of a proposition (subject or predicate) compared
with the other. The usual definition of the School is perhaps
clearer, and serves to explain the former: Supposition is the use of
a term for anything whatever. So long as a term stands alone, it
