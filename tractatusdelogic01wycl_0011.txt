INTRODUCTION. Vll

fui futurus quadragenarius in hoc instanti ¹), would incline me to
place Logica quite at the beginning of Wyclif's Oxford career, and
consequently at about the same period as the Questiones XIII recently
edited by Dr. Beer.2 Dr. Buddensieg, who has debated the question of
the period ad which Wyclif first denied the possibility of annihilation,
would concur in placing the date of the work before 1352ss Wyclif, if born
in 1324, as is usually believed, was only 37 in 1361, and could, therefore,
say with truth: ‘Sum futurus quadragenarius in hoc instanti'3 though,
of course, this argument would have but little value by itself, and the
uncertainty of the date of his birth tends yet more to diminish its value-

Οτι the other hand, it is not generally supposed that Wyclif's
system had even begun to develop into theological heterodoxy at
such an early date3 yet we find4 this proposition given as an
example in the present volume: Anticristus est Rome; an example
which, however insignificant by itself, becomes strikingly significative
when viewed in connection with the writer⁷s later opinions on the
Pope and the Papacy. Again, we have5 as an instance of argument
by analogy: ‘Sicut vixerunt Apostoli in ecclesia primitiva, sic eciam
tenentur episcopi vivere circa finem mundi.³ This is the very doctrine
that Wyclif was destined to maintain with such energy in his theo-
logical works, for of course, ifpoverty is a duty for bishops, it is still
more so for the inferior priesthood. Moreover, towards the end of
the third part (Ι believe in the last chapter, but am not able to
quote the passage, the MS. being now in the printer’s hands) Wyclif
speaks of himself as an old man, esenex', and not going to give up
his opinions. I need not mention a date given in the last chapter of
the same third part, as that of the very year at which he was then
writing3 for it is, so far as I can remember, 1383 or 1385! It is
indeed possible that this great treatise was left unfinished until the
last years of Wyclif’s life3 which would account both for the
expression ³senex³ and for the date; so we must not necessarilly
conclude that the number given is wrong. But it is much more
likely that it may have been changed from 1361 (?) by the
ignorant correction of a scribe writing in 1383. As to the allusion
