XL INTRODUCTION,

to the confusing manner in which Wyclif sometimes, after having
granted a whole series of propositions from a given principle which
he certainly seems to admit, stops us with: Hoc est falsum, or
impossibile. He concludes the chapter with a short mention of the
usual four sorts of proof‚ and affirms that he does not value much
the fallacies that exist on that subject: an assertion with which most
people will heartily agree.

Chap. XIl. Of the Contingent (p. 166—177). There is the con·
tingent of indetermination (ad utrumlibet), an effect depending on
free-will3 then the contingent called enatural‘‚ that does not thus
depend. The latter is an effect that happens always) or in most cases,
or in few.

Here Wyclif opens a long parenthesis to bring in his theory
of determinate and indeterminate truth‚ the latter pertaining to the
Contingent of Indetermination, and· not without influence on the
doctrine of free-will. It may be briefly stated thus: Everything that
is true at a given time is so determinately; what may be true
without any precise fixation of time, is indeterminate truth. All
indetermination depends upon the future, for the present and the
past are determined. God is the ultimate cause of indetermination‚1
and the human will is the immediate cause3 for the contingent of
indetermination is alone indeterminately true. And such contingent
truths depend on the will,2 Returning to the main point, we find
that the Contingent in all cases has an unfailing cause; that the
Contingent in most cases has a cause which is natural, but not
unfailing3 and that the Contingent in few cases has a cause, but
not one naturally ordered to produce that effect. Here we touch the
vexed question as to whether monsters are intended by nature.
Wyclif thinks they are, and very keenly points out3 that i'f not
intended by nature, because they occur in the minority of cases,
then children would also not be intended by nature; for the causes
having been posited‚ they certainly do not corne into the world in
the majority of cases.

We next come to the question of chance. Chance points to a
cause that occasions a thing happening in the minority of cases, and
