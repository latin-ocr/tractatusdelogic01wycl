IN'I'RODUCTION. XLIII

non-being.¹ ssut here comes the difficulty. Are these Nows separate
instants? Wyclif says that such as do not admit his system of
‘indivisible’ points etc„ are obliged to say that death takes
place in two separate instants1‘2 ‘Instant' may mean eternity,3 which
is not successive, but is indivisible. If anything begins, its beginning
also begins, and where movement to and fro ceases, there is a point
where both movement and rest begin and end.

On p. 195 Wyclif affirms his position, which he proves only
in the Third Tractare, towards the end. eThe Continuous is made
up of ‘indivisibles²; time, of instants3 the line, of points; the surface
of lines, the volume, of surfaces; and movement, of acts of change
(ex mutari). This opinion maintains that nothing can possibly begin
or cease to be except at some present tirne; and so the two instants
touch one another (sunt immediata). We may here leave the subject.

The rest of the chapter consists os rules and conclusions which
are not very easy to understand: In some places, Wyclif seems ‘to
contradict himself.4 However, there are two difficulties that deserve
notice; one5 concerning the beginning of time at creation, whether
there was, or was not, a cessation of non-entity when the world was
created. The other6 is whether God was Lord of all, or not Lord of
all, before the Creation. The answer is, that Not-Lord and not Lord
are two very different thingS.

Chap. XV. Of Per Se and Per Accidens (p. 203-—212). It is
very difficult to analyze this chapter. It consists of a multitude of
details, distinctions and remarks, undoubtedly very useful to students
of Scholastic logie, but hard to condense. The side notes being full,
here as everywhere else, I may refer the reader to them, and say
a few words about the general definitions only, as here laid down.

Per Se applies either to a genus, or the abstract Substance,
or a concrete being, or to the Uncaused Being. Per Accidens ans-
wers to the different meanings of Accident. Some are separable,
others inseparable. To say that A is B per se, means that it is Β
because it is A, but it may be so more or less directly. A is per se
a man, a living being, a substance3 he is a man directly. Per
