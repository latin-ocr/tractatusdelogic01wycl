XIV INTRODUCTION.

Here I must point out the difference between Wyclif's system and that of
more moderate Realists. But I shall ask to be believed provisionally,
because the essence of his doctrine is not sufficiently set forth in
this volume to help the reader by references to any particular place
where it is to be found, and it would be too long to quote extracts
from his hitherto unpublished works. Moderate Realists would admit
analogical identity3 but they would maintain that, being analogical,
it is not real, except in the mind of the subject who thinks of it,
with some sort of foundation in the nature of thingS. But Wyclif
goes further. God is not the creature3 and yet He is identical With
the creature, in so far as mere ‘being³ goes. God is Being3 the
creature is also a being; and to that extent they are identical.
But Being is only that which is God, as it is only that which is the
creature. Now, it is impossible logically to conclude that if that
which is A is that which is B, then A is Β, because in the con-
clusion, that which, concreted in A, has no longer the same meaning
as tlzat which, concreted in Β. This is the substance of Wyclif's reply
to the objection that accuses him of identifying God with His creature,
making substance to be accident, et quodlibet quidlibet. He makes
a very strong point of the mystery of the Trinity, in which tlzat
which is the Father (viz. God) is tlzczt which is the Son3 yet the
Father is not the Son. But perhaps his point of view will be clearer
to the reader‚ if we take a less mysterious instance, Glass is that
which is hard,· hardness is a real quality; it is also that which is
transparent‚ and transparency is also a real quality. And yet hard-
ness is not transparency.

The second degree is generic identity, which obtains between
two species. Men and beasts are really identical in substantiality. The
third is specific identity, between two individuals. Socrates and
Plato are really identical in humanity. And the fourth degree is
numerical identity, which exists between the various parts of one
and the same being. Memmy, for instance, reason and will are
different, but numerically identical in each individua] soul. And to
all the objections urged against this real identity, Wyclif replies by
considering Universal Being‚ or Substance, or Humanity, or an indi-
vidual smil, as a real subject, that which possesses the attributes
that conie under its extension. Deity and ‘createdimss’ in one case,
