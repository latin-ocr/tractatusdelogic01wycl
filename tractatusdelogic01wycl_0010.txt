VI INTRODUCTION.

other philosophical works not yet published, which I have repeatedly
had occasion to collate. Of course, in each treatise there occur a
good many sidetheories that are not to be found elsewhere3 but
wherever the same difficulty presents itself, it is solved in the other
treatises where it crops up, by the same principles, and almost in the same
words as in the present work. Allowing for the gradual development of
Wyclif's doctrines, this striking unity is, Ithink, sufficient to complete the
proof of the authenticity of Logica, and of all the other works that,-
having as much extrinsic evidence in their favour, are also able to
stand this test. Take, for instance, the way in which our author, in
the little summary of Logic with which the work begins, sets us
from the outset on our guard against the ‘suppositoriaP syllogism.¹
Now, in almost every one of the other works, there occurs this very
same great objection of W'yclif's adversaries, answered on tlte very
same lines. “They said: According to you, the real Universal Man
is identical with Peter3 this same real Universal Man is identical
with Paul: if so, then Peter is Paul2'. Wyclif replies here that ‘hoc'
(i. e. the Universal Man, who being real, may be pointed out by a
demonstrative pronoun) has not the same supposition in the major
premise as in the minor; and in De Universalihus, De Tempore,
De Ideis, De Materia et Forma, and other works where the same
objection recurs under various forms, the same answer is repeated
with developments adapted to the subject-matter. Instances of the
same sort might be almost indefinitely multiplied, but for the fact
that no competent judge will, after reading the present volume
through, hesitate for one instant to set it down to Wyclif.

As for the date of the work, that is — as is usual with most
of our author's productioris —— quite another affair. Judging from his
tone, certain hesitations here and there in the work, the somewhat
diffident way in which he acknowledges that some ideas of his are
not agreeable to the young students, his admission of annihilation
as a hypothesis against which he makes no protest*2 here, but which
he afterwards in the third part of Logica, denies as improbable, and
in De Universalibus, as absolutely impossible, together with an
example he gives (Deus potest facere quod ego non sum nec
