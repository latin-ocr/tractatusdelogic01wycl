XXVI INTRODUCTION.

of that process is right. Not only men are mortal . . . no men are
mortal. No man is a plant not only men are plantS. — We
may notice here that not should be taken as modifying the whole
proposition, not the adverb only3 thus signifying: It is not true
that only . . . .

Chap. XV. Of Exceptive Propositz'ons (p. 53-56). The same
observation as before applies to the present chapter. Three rules
besides those of exposition are given. (1.) Any exceptive proposition
(Every A but Β is C) is incompatible with its prejacent (Every A
is C). (2.) From an exceptive affirmative proposition we may conclude
a negative (exceptivam negativam in the text; but this does not
agree with the examples); and from a negative exceptive, an affir-
mative: ‘Every A but Β is C Β is not C. No A but Β is C
Β is C’. (3.) Any proposition may be true by making it except all
that it does not truly include.

Chap. XVI. Of Copulatz've Propositions (p. 56—57). This
chapter and the following one seem to be slightly out of their place.
Copulative and disjunctive propositions, being hypothetical‚ belong
to the Third Tractate3 and the author has not yet terminated his
summary of categorical propositions, that are dealt with at length
in the First and Second Tractate. The rules given are: (ι.) If one
part of a copulative (A is Β and C is Β) is false, so is the whole
proposition, unless it be negative, with not prefixed to the whole.
(2.) If the whole be true, each part is true. (3.) From one part
of a copulative to the whole, vve have a false inference‚ unless the
second inferred part be implied by the other. (4.) The contradictory
to a copulative is a disjunctive made out of the contradictories to
each part: ‘A is Β and C is D: either A is not Β or C is not Β.)

Chap. XVII. Of Disjunctz've Propositions (p. 58, 59). RuIes:
(Ι.) If vve admit a disjunctive: ‘Either A is Β or C is Β), and deny
one part: ‘C is D, we have the true inference: ‘A is Β). (2.) We
cannot generally thus infer one part unless vve deny the other; there
are exceptions nevertheless. (3.) The contradictory to a disjunctive
is a copulative made of the contradictories to each part: ‘Either A
is Β or C is D: A is not Β and C is not Β.)

Very little is to be said of Chaps. XVIII, XIX and XX (oo—67).
