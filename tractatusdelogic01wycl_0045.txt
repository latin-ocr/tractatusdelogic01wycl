quite aside from the natural tendency of the cause. If out of a
hundred balls, ten are white, and ninety black, a man that draws a
white ball does so by chance3 if fifty were white and fifty black, it
would not happen in the minority of cases that the white ball is
drawn3 so it would no longer be by chance; and if sixty were white
and the rest black, it would be still less the result of chance, for
here we have a decided cause: the superior number of white balls
that make for the drawing of a white one. This is of course far
from the modern definition of chance. -- But the same thing may
occur by chance and not by chance3 as the meeting of a debtor
with his creditor. Chance and fortune differ, in that the latter supposes
a being working to overcome chance.1 ‘Naturally,³ ‘by chance,³ evio-
lently‚³ ‘supernaturally,³ ‘volitionally' and ‘artificially’ are not, accor-
ding to Wyclif, terms mutually incompatible. Yet he notices that
some think that they are.

As we have already seen, Wyclif also thinks that necessity and
contingency are not absolutely opposed; this is a sequel of his
system. God creates men necessarily, it does not follow that the
creation is not also contingent. All these words are contradictory
only when taken in similar senses.

It is well known that Wyclif⁷s doctrines of necessity were
condemned at the Council of Constance. I do not deny that the
manner in which he expresses himself, taken according to the usual
meaning of words, lays itself open to the charge of heterodoxy. But
in most of what I have seen of his philosophical works, he explains
his meaning with sufficient lucidity to clear him from the charge.
whether, in those of his theologica} treatises that followed and were
condemned, he goes a step further, Ι do not pretend to say here.
But indeed the Church usually, condemning propositions in the
literal sense (quatenus verba sonant), looks less to the meaning of
the author than to that which they are likely to convey, and to the
danger that may result therefrom. When Wyclif tells us that sin
occurs necessarily, and means that, given God’s foreknowledge of
sin to exist, sin must also exist at some time, it was quite natural
that people who did not understand his meaning should have been
