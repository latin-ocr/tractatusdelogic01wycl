THE EARLY ENGLISH TEXT Socmrv was started by Dr. Furnivall in 1864 for the
purpose of bringing the rnass of Old English Literature within the reach of the
ordinary student, and of wiping away the reproach under which England had long
rested, of having felt little interest in the monuments of her early life and language.

On the starting of the Society, so many Texts of importance were at once taken
in hand by its Editors, that it became necessary in 1867 to open, besides the
Orz'gz'nal Series with which the Society began, an Extra Series which should be
mainly devoted to fresh editions of all that is tnost valuable in printed MSS. and
Caxton's and other black-letter books, though first editions of MSS. will not be
excluded when the convenience of issuing completed Texts demands their inclusion
in the Extra Series.

During the twenty-eight years of the Society’s existence, it has produced, with
whatever shortcomings, an amount of good solid work sor which all students of our
Language, and some of our Literature, must be grateful, and which has rendered
possible the beginnings (at least) of proper Histories and Dictionaries of that Lan—
guage and Literature‚ and has illustrated the thoughts, the life, the manners and
customs of our forefathers.

But the Society's experience has shown the very small number 0f those inheritors
of the speech of Cynewulf, chancer, and Shakspere who care two guineas a year
for the records os that speech. ⁴ Let the dead past bury its dead' is still the cry
of Great Britain and her Colonies, and of America, in the rnatter of language.
The Society has never had money enough to produce the Texts that could easily
have been got ready for it; and many Editors are now anxious to send to press
the work they have prepared. The necessity has therefore arisen sor trying
whether more texts can be got out by the plan of issuing them in advance of the
current year, so that those Members who like to pay for them by advance Sub-
scriptions. can do so. while those who prefer to wait for the year for which the
volumes are rnarkt, can do so too. To such waiters. the plan will be no injury,
but a gain, as every year's Texts will then be ready on the New Year’s Day on
which the Subscription for them is paid.

The success of this plan will depend on the support it receives from Members,
as it is obvious that the Society's printers must be paid half or two-thirds of their
bill for a Text within a few months of its production. Appeal is therefore made
to all menibers who can spare advance Subscriptions, to pay thern as soon as they
get notice that the Texts for any future year are ready. In 1892, the Texts for
1893 and 1894 will be ready, and also perhaps some for 1895.

The Subscription to the Society. which constitutes niernbership, is ΑΙ Is. a year
[and ,ζῙ Is. additional for the EXTRA SERIES], due in advance on the Ist of
JANUARY, and should be paid either to the Society's Account at the Head Office
ot the Union Bank of London. Princes Street, London, EC.. or by Cheque,
Postal Order, or Money-Order to the Hon. Secretary, W. A. DALZIEL, Esq.. 67,
Victoria Road, Finsbury Park, London, N., and crost ‘Union Bank of London.'
(United-States Subscribers must pay sor postage 15. 4cl. a year extra for the
Original Series, and 15. a year for the Extra Series.) The Society's Texts are also
sold separately at the prices put after them in the Lists.
