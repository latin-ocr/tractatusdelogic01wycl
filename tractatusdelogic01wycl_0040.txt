XXXVI INTRODUCTION.

Many fallacies can be solved by such extension of meaning.
‘A bishop (that is to be) will see Socrates, who will never be seen
by a bishop (that is so n011²)³ &c.; the sense of the verb is here
ampliated as to time, and that ought to be borne in mind. So of
the other fallacies given on p. 112, 113.

Chap. VII. Qf tlze Particular Negative (p. 116—121). The
salient point of this chapter is a fifth sort of proof brought forward
under the name of captio, and refuted. Wyclif has J'ust said that
‘what is not intelligible to me cannot be understood by me.³ It is
objected that ‘something unintelligible is understood by me,³ since
I understand its absurdity. So eI understand what is not intelligible
to me.a But the fact is that we do not know the sense of the pro-
position, for it has none. All we know is that it has no sense. And:
thus the fifth sort, captiuus proof, is valueless.

Second Trai-tate. Chap. VIII. Of Difference and Otlzerness
(p. 121—128). To differ, according to Wyclif, is thus expounded:
‘A differs from B A is, B is at the same time, and A is not B?
There can be no difference, if there be not a certain simultaneity.
Some of the conclusions which he indicates rather than proves are
cutinus, and remind us of certain modern philosophers. For instance,
the Sixtlz Conclztsion.¹ tA man may differ frorn an ass, but not every
ass would differ from him3 for if 'ne differs and they differ at the
same instant, the very fact would prove a certain identity. -— Seventh
Conclusion. εΑ man may differ from every man, and yet not from
every man past, present, and future.³ Ez‘ghtlz conclusion. tA man may
differ from that which is white, and yet never come to differ, nor
even be able to differ from that which is white,’ because2 ethat
which is white³ has particular extension, not universal, in the present
tense, and a universal one in the past and future. Thatwlziclz differs
is tlzat wliiclz will not differ; that which is other than true will be
true. The supposiffion, it is seen, bears upon the tlzczt wlziclz, the
mysterious subject of all changes and differences. Many Hegelian ideas
are here undeveloped, and wrupped up in Scholastic phraseology3
but I think it more than doubtful whether Wyclif ever developed
them, even in his mind. He was carried away in another direction.
