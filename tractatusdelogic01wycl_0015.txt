INTRODUCTION. XI

no writer is so much given to digressions as he. In the first, and
still more in the second tractate of Logicae Continuatio, they begin
to appear; though he probably was of opinion that, writing of the
Infinite, he was only dealing with the effect which that term has
upon the proposition into which it is brought. But to deal with that
effect, the meaning of the word, i. e. the thing itself, has to be con-
sidered; and thus, treating of otlzerness and dzfference, of beginning
and ending, &c., he manages to put a great deal of Metaphysic into
his Logic. He goes still further in the third Tractate3 questions of
political economy, of optics, of anatomy, of astronomy, and what not,
are discussed in connection with the different hypothetical propositions.

In this respect, Wyclif's Logica differs immensely from the
work of Occam that bears the same name. There, all is in strict
order3 ‘the book is divided, subdivided and re-subdivided, until we
get to each individual proposition forming a link in the long and
massive chain formed by the great Nominalist: the proposition is
posited and demonstrated; each objection against it is in turn
propounded and solved. Yet Wyclif is far more interesting, even
when we must admit that his digressions go beyond all bounds;
without Occam's affectation of mathematical order, Wyclif has as
much of the true philosophical spirit as he: as for subtlety and
originality of views, he perhaps has more,

b) Derailed Examination of each part.

We may now proceed to examine the whole of the prelirninary
abstract and of the two first treatises, chapter by chapter. With
regard to the abstract, and also more or less to the rest, it will be
useless to go into details. The abstract of an abstract, if intelligible
at all, would be hardly readable; and to explain every difficulty at
length would be to write a treatise, not an Introduction. Ι shall,
therefore, confine myself to noting the general plan on which
Wyclif proceed53 stopping to give explanadons, so far as l am able
to give any (which unfortunately l cannot always do) whenever
anything particularly important and hard of understanding occurs.
