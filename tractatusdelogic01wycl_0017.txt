INTRODUCTION XIII

genus, individual, are of the second intention, and 50 also are man,
angel, 111 50 far as they a-re here considered as universal or singular.
— Terms of the first or second imposition differ in so far as the
first have some craison d'etre' in their objects themselves, and the
second are merely imposed by the developement of human language.
They are, 111 short, mere grammatical expressions. Thus: man, in
Man is mortal, is a term of the first intention and imposition3 in
Man is α species, it is a term of the second intention but the first,
imposition3 and in Man is a substantive, it becomes a term of the
second imposition.

Chap. 11. Of Universals (p. 8—11). There are, says Wyclif,
three sorts of universal things: things that cause universally, as
God; things that communicate themselves universally, as lzzcmanz'ty·
to each individual man, and things that represent universally, as all
general termS, written or uttered. Logic has to do with the last
class only, of which there is a five-sold division, famous under the
name of Predicables. First, the Genus, which answers the question
What? for many species. — Second, the Species, that answers the
question What? for many individuals. — Third, the Dzfference,
answering the questi0n Hom? and separating one species from all
others. Man is an animated being3 that is the genus. How is he
animated 50 35 to distinguish him from all others? By rationality.
Rationality, present in man, absent in all others, is the species-
making or specg'fic difference. — Fourth, the Property (proprium)
or characteristic, is a mark by which alone we can distinguish a
species; for it extends as far as the specific difference itself. Wyclif
gives lauglzter as the characteristic of man, which might be objected
to, since men deprived of reason ought to have the faculty of
laughing also taken away: whereas such is not the case. ssut it is
enough to have pointed out what the ‘proprium' means„ ——— Fifth and
last, the Accident. This is defined as a mere happening, a pheno-
menon that is not always present in the same subject; or, if always,
that may be present in others as well.

The note on Identity, which ends the chapter, is instructive. All
things, God and His creatures, says Wyclif, are identical 311111οξςίεε111γ.1
