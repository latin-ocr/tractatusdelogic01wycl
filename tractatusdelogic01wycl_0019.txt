INTRODUCTION. XV

humanity and brute nature in the other3 in the third —- if I may be
allowed to use such terms -— Socrateity and Platoneity; and in the
last, the memory, the reason, and the will. And he stoutly maintains
all through that to admit as valid the objection already noticed
would necessarily bring us to deny the Trinity, Christ's Incarnation,
and even all human science.

Chap. ΙΙΙ. Of Categories (p. 11, 12). Being is divided into
ten categories: substance, quantity, quality, relation, action, passion,
locality, time, position and belonging. Wyclif continues here to deal
with the Universa183 but these categories, or predicaments, have
objective existence, and corne under the ‘first intention' of the mind3
whilst the former class (predicables) exist in thought alone, and
belong to the second intention: a genus, a species, &a does not
exist by itself as a substance does.

Wyclif, with all the Scholastics, follows Aristotle closely; but
as Aristotle has been ridiculed for his enumeration of categorieS,
which J. S. Mill says “is like a division of animals into men,
quadrupedS‚ horses, asses, and ponies³²,¹ I may perhaps be allowed
to give a justification of its adequacy that I remember to have read
in Father Liberatore’s Logica3 though, not having the work by me,
Ι do not want to render the author responsible for any short-
comings of my own. Whether Aristotle understood his own classi-
fication in the same light, matters litt1e3 but so determined a
Thornist as Father Liberatore is surely entitled to speak for the
Schoolmen on this point.

All Being is either a subject of attributeS, or one of the attri-
butes themselves. In the former case, it is Substance, In the latter,
the attribute’s existence is either in itself or in other beings. If in
itself, and at the same time it gives its subjects intensive parts or
degreeS, either of entity or of imperfection, it is called Quality. If
the subject receives from it only extensive parts, which differ from
quality by being mutually exclusive, each one outside of the other
(partes extra partes) we have Quantiyf. If the attribute only exists
in (or for) other beings (ad aliud, πρός τι.) it either indicates 3
change or a fixed state. If a change, we have the two corresponding.
