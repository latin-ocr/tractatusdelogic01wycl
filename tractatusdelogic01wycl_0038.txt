XXXIV INTRODUCTION.

overcome, but is better eluded by taking the contradictories of such
proposstions, and proving their falsity.

A similar process is to be followed, if the verb is in the past
or the future tense. The first exponent is affirmative, and contains
the verb in the past or future; the second, negative, has the verb in
the present, disjoined by or from the same verb repeated in the past
or future, as the case may be. Wyclif adds1 a few observations on
the descensus ad singularia, for which I may refer the reader to
the foot-note, and to What has already been said on the subject.

d) The predicate may vary the sense in as many ways as the
subject. The relative pronoun often causes confusion, as in this case:
‘Omnis pater generat individuum de sua substancia, cui est similis
specie.³ For men of the present day, it is rather a grammatical than
a logical quibble. Wyclif lays down the sule that the relative should
stand for its nearest antecedent, unless the sense be unmistakably
clear, and closes the chapter by mentioning the fallacy called Amphi-
bology.

Chap. V. Of tlze Universal Negative (p. loo—107), The four
sorts of demonstration come in here, as in the case of the universal
affirmative. The singulars of any universal negative are found by
taking the singular affirmative and prefixing not. A universal negative
needs no middle term to descend to its singulars by3 because, as
we may remember, it can be converted simply: so it cannot be
properly expounded. Each singular, however, of a universal negative
may be true, and yet the universal may be impossible3 v. g: ‘This
animal is not of a certain size' . . . . tThis other, ditto³ . . . . and
so on, until every singular animal is enumerated. All are true, yet
the universal, cNo animal is of any size,³ is evidently false. Wyclif
explains this difficulty with particular care.

In the third sort of proof — argument ab absurdo — there occur
specimens of logical juggles. Sophists take up this principle: ‘What-
ever is opposed to a certain universal is false3 therefore that universal
is true.3 One example may suffice. <Notlzing³ can work: as many
mir-acles as G0d; for, if not, then something could; which is false.
‘Notlzing³ is therefore as pon'etfful as God. We must observe that
