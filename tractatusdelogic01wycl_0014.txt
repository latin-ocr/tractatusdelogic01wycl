X INTRODUCTION.

sorts of propositions, and especially of those called hypothetical.³
He himself points out that the third treatise goes more into the
questions connected with hypothetical propositions than the work
of any other logician before him.¹

It may be asked why the plan of Wyclif so completely leaves
out argumentation and syllogisms, when these formed so vital a
part of the old Scholastic system. The answer is obvious: they were
not required. His cmanual for beginners' — as I may call the first
pages —— contains, very concisely and briefly, it is true, all that was
absolutely requisite. But the rest of the work is not addressed ‘to
beginners, but to men who were perfectly at home in all the figures
and moods of syllogisms, and only wanted to see their way to take
a Realistic view of Logic, then very much obscured by the objections
which the prevailing Nominalism had piled up 011 all sides. Wyclif⁷s work
was written to supply a want, and not to repeat what everybody knew,

Ι cannot even help fancying, as 1 said above, that from the
beginning Wyclif had some vague idea of reacting, not only against
Nominalism, but also against many theological doctrines then in
vogue. He wanted to form a band of devoted followers among the
students in the schools of Oxford3 and we find on the very first
page of his work the motto of all his later controversies and con-
flicts; the motto which gained for him amongst his disciples the
title of Doctor Evangelicus. The work he composed is, he
declares in the proemium, the Logic of ΗΘΖ] Writ. From the be-
ginning of his career (if Logiccz is, as Ι believe, one of his first
works) he raises his standard with a determined hand, and no doubt,
as we may infer from the tone of the proemium, expects many
zealous followers to crowd round it. We shall not be far wrong
then, Ι think, if we consider Logica as but the first commencernent
of a concerted movement, partly instinctive perhaps, but not blindly
503 cognizant of the road taken, though not of the goal to vvhiCh it
would lead, and recognizing as the rule, both of faith and of right
reasoning, the Holy Scriptores above all things

We must not, however, imagine that Wyclif keeps strictly all
through to what we should call the proper field of Logic. Perhaps
