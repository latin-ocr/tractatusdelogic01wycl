INTRODUCTION. XXXI

nor false; or rather, both at once. And, according as the primary
signification admits the idea of necessary or contingent truth, or
impossibilior, the proposition itself belongs to one or other of these
three classes, Thus truth‚ according to Aristode, is the fact of a
proposition, meaning the thing that is3 but to those who deny the
Universals‚ it means only ideas, not things.

Chap. ΙΙ. Of Demonstration (p. 79-82). sense, or intuition‚ or
inference from both, is the source of all proof. Mediate inference may
proceedi: a) Α Priori, as the inference of an effect from its cause3
b) A Posteriori‚ as the demonstration of a cause by its effects; c) Ab
Aequo, proving one thing by another that comes to the same3 and
d) Ab Ahsurdo, proving that the contradictory proposition is self-
contradictory. Sometimes one sort of proof is preferable, sometimes
another3 any true proposition can be proved; and we are always
free to grant a proposition, if one of its primary senses be true.

Chap. ΙΙΙ. Distinctions Qf Terms (p. 82—85). Some terms can
be analyzed completely, i. e. down to their singulars3 others are only
exponible into the propositions which they imply. ‘Official’ terms
merely determine the supposition of the other terms in the propo-
sition: the foregoing distinctions are nevertheless not mutually ex-
clusive. A universal proposition may be the same as its exponents‚
but is not always so; in some cases there is more absolute truth on
one side„ Official terms must be carefully repeated in the exposition,
that confusion may be avoided3 and terms, when we repeat them,
must always be understood in the same sense.

Chap. IV. Of tlte Universal Affirmative (p. 85—100). Every
such proposition may be proved (ι.) Α Priori, (2.) A Posteri0ri‚ as
already noticed‚ or (3.) by proving the falsity of its opposite3 or
(4.) Ex aequm· that is by expounding it. We prove, for instance,
that ‘Every A is 13³, if we prove that ‘Some A is 13³, and that ‘No
A is not ss’. This method is the most employed of all. Wyclif‚
however points out that 'No A is not Β3 is merely the universal
affirmative under a negative form.

This exposition undergoes four sorts of variations. a) According
as the quantifying sign is is of different genderS, or common (quis-
que, quaeque, or omnis); h) According as the subject is simple or
compound3 it may also be of one or other of the genderS‚ or epicene3
