possibly A is B.

Ex afflig? Α ²³ 1. B '52‘' is blank, as also seventeen leaves that follow, of

necessarily Β,- which four have been cut, and nine torn out, so that there remain

thesespse Α t'sBonly four. The pagination (B 33³) is continued aster the blank

⁶⁰⁷²t²7²3entls' leaves. As may have been seen, the MS. Β, notwithstanding a
good many defeets, is superior to Α. The third part of Logica,
forming a separate volume, is only in B3 and from here to the
end of this volume, we have only Α. We are, therefore, now
entering on the most difficult part of the work3 for the matter
