Vlll INTRODUCTION.

to Antichrist, and the doctrine of evangelical poverty‚ they may be
set aside as mere coincidences; but I prefer to think that the germs
of the whole of Wyclif's system were already in his mind at the
age of 37, if he wrote Logica then3 and that he brought them
forward sometimes (as here) tentatively andin the shape of examples,
in order to accustorn his disciples‚ over whom he already had
some influence,¹ to follow in his wake.

Logica thus seems to me to be decidedly one of Wyclif’s very
first works. The appearances to the contrary may easily be explained3
and besides the intrinsic and extrinsic proofs of its early date, we
must rernember the universal habit of Schoolmen. They always
began, as it is indeed quite natural to begin, the whole course of
philosophical studies and teaching, by a three years' course of Logic.

Logica is curious from more than one point of view. The
modern logician will find himself completely at sea. Inducfion, the
grand clzeval de bataille of most writers on Logic at the present day,
is dismissed (contemptuously‚ I might say, but that Wyclif had cer-
tainly not that feeling) in the short space of two lines and a half.
Not quite without reason from his own point of view, which is also
to some extent that of the editor. That the study of deductive
Logic is of use to those who engage in abstruse metaphysical and
ethical pursuits; that it is far from useless even in politics and
debate‚ can hardly be called in question by any man of average
intelligence. But, if we ask whether any scientific investigator ever
prepared himself for his career by a careful study of the intricate
rules of induction, or found himself better enabled to discover the
laws of Nature by their aid, the answer will at the best be very
doubtful indeed. As a fact, the rules of Induction, cleverly formulated
as they may be, are scarcely more than mere curiosities in them-
selves, and are based upon long deductive processeS. Given two men,
both equally intelligent, equally inclined to study natural Science,
