expounding3 151, when the latter term
compared comprises an infinite multi-
tude, none of which is supreme, ib„-
such comparisons are impossible, for the
equality implies that one must be
supreme, 2193 fild, when the aforesaid
comparison is modified by the com-
parative degree (negation of equality)
and difference of time, 2203 those who
admit the theory of indivisible parts
making up the Continuous will admit
that a supreme degree must exist, 2203
how to expound a proposition in the
comparative, 221; comparison is im-
possible unless both terms compared
really have the same quality, 2223 how
to expound superlatives, 2233 both terms
must be homogeneous, 224, loose
meanings given by literary men and
orators to the superlative, ila,- three
differences between the comparative
and the superlative, ib.‚· all the signs
of comparison generally render the
following terms distributive, 2253 ex-
ceptions to this rule, ila,- a peculliarity
about the distribution of the term that
follows the superlative, 2263 mutual
exposition of comparatives, ib.,· it is
not useless, since one proposition is
put for another, and explains its sense,

sitive, and another comparative with
less and the terms reversed, ib.,· in-
