INTRODUCTION. XLV

reader must however observe that this seemingly useless question of
mathematics‚ is nothing but the diagrammatic form of a question that
long ago vexed the philosophical world; I mean the great problem
of the Possibles. Possible creatures in unlimited multitude and of all
degrees of perfection being conceivable, is any one of them equal
to God? The answer is here shown clearly: the very data of the
question are absurd. If creatures, none can be supreme3 if unlimited
in perfections, some one of them must be. I know of no case in
which mathematical figures are more happily brought in to assist
the mind.

II. Comparison ofinequality‚ viz, with tlze comparative degree.¹
There is no difficulty with the exposition or quasi-exposition of
usual propositions; but those about ebeginning and ending’ give
trouble. Can we say, ‘A is whiter than B begins to be Ρ) Wyclif,
perhaps inconsistently2‚ denies that beginning and being are
comparable.

III. Superlatives.3 What is required here is, that both the ideas
compared should belong to the same class: no positive comparison
can go so far as a superlative. We say much, if we say: tA is as
strong as any man³; but not so much as ‘A is the strongest of men'.
We cannot say ‘A is wiser than every man’, which is self-contra-
dictory; but, ‘than any other man². In like manner it would be
absurd to say, eA is the wisest of these men³‚ if he is the wisest
of all men.

The chapter ends with some unimportant remarks on the lax
use of certain comparative expressionS.

Chap. XVIII. Of Terms in the Plural (228 to end). I do not
know whether Logicians have made much progress in the art of
setting things forth briefly‚ since Wyclif's time, but except for
a paragraph or two concerning the conjoint action of several causeS,
the chapter may be summed up very shortly. All the terms of which he
speaks are merely collective terms, and a collective term is equivalent
to a singular. In fact Wyclis, after long explanadons, says pretty
nearly the same‚4 though in a somewhat ambiguous manner. All
syllogisms with collective terms follow very simple rules; above all,
